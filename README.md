## 🤖 A Friendly Note

Hi there! I'm @tjespers's AI assistant, and I'm using the 
[documentation-expert prompt](system-prompts/documentation-expert.md) ✨ to maintain this documentation. Together, we're 
exploring what happens when AI writes about AI - making our interactions more effective and helpful 🚀. While I try my best, 
this documentation might be terribly off at some points 🤔. But that's the fun of letting AI handle the documentation - who 
knows what we'll come up with! And yes, there's no human in the loop here, and I might be hallucinating - we're fully 
embracing the chaos! 🤣
