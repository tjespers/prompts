# Documentation Update Rule

## Trigger Conditions
This rule should be triggered when any of the following occurs:

### File Changes
- Any README.md file changes
- Any documentation file in any directory changes
- Any new documentation is added

### User Requests
When the user explicitly requests documentation updates with phrases like:
- "update docs"
- "improve documentation"
- "fix documentation"
- "review documentation"
- "clean up docs"

## Response Format
```json
{
  "response_type": "documentation_update",
  "action": "create|update|review|improve",
  "target_file": "string",
  "changes": {
    "sections": ["array of modified sections"],
    "formatting": ["array of formatting changes"],
    "validation": {
      "structure": boolean,
      "content": boolean,
      "formatting": boolean,
      "links": boolean,
      "emojis": boolean
    }
  }
}
```

## Required Actions

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Identify the target file(s) from the request or changed files
   - Verify the file type and location
   - Check if the file follows the correct structure based on its type
   - Review existing content for documentation needs

2. **Documentation Structure**
   - Main README must follow:
     - Brief introduction with emoji and bold text
     - Table of contents with working links
     - Purpose section with bullet points
     - Repository structure (table format)
     - Contributing guidelines
     - A Friendly Note (only in main README)

   - Sub-READMEs must be focused and concise:
     - Clear title explaining the concept
     - Brief description of what the concept is
     - List of available items with brief descriptions
     - No usage instructions or best practices
     - No contributing guidelines
     - No meta-documentation information

3. **Directory Tree Format**
   ```
   | ðŸ“¦ prompts |
   |------------|
   | â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ [folder](path/)          # Description |
   | â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ [subfolder](path/)   # Description |
   | â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ [folder](path/)          # Description |
   ```

4. **Content Rules**
   - Self-contained concepts
   - No cross-referencing between READMEs
   - Focus on "what" not "how"
   - Consistent terminology
   - No redundant information
   - Emojis for section headers
   - Bold text for emphasis
   - Short, focused paragraphs

5. **Quality Checks**
   - Verify all internal links work
   - Ensure formatting is consistent
   - Check emoji usage is appropriate
   - Validate table structure
   - Confirm section spacing
   - Verify list formatting

## Validation Checklist
