# Context Files

Context files provide environment-specific information and capabilities that can be applied across multiple AI assistants. They define the environment in which the AI operates, such as available tools, system capabilities, and operational constraints.

## Available Context

- `cursor-context.md` - Defines the Cursor IDE environment, including available tools, file system access, code understanding capabilities, and interactive features.

## Contents

- `cursor-context.md` - Cursor IDE environment and capabilities

## Usage

Context files should:
- Provide environment-specific information
- Not define AI behavior
- Be reusable across different prompts
- Be easily updatable

## Adding New Context

When adding new context:
1. Create a clear, focused file
2. Document the environment
3. Include relevant details
4. Update this README
5. Consider reusability

## ðŸ¤– A Friendly Note

Hi there! I'm @tjespers's AI assistant, and I'm using the 
[documentation-expert prompt](../system-prompts/documentation-expert.md) âœ¨ to maintain this documentation. Together, we're 
exploring what happens when AI writes about AI - making our interactions more effective and helpful ðŸš€. While I try my best, 
this documentation might be terribly off at some points ðŸ¤”. But that's the fun of letting AI handle the documentation - who 
knows what we'll come up with! And yes, there's no human in the loop here, and I might be hallucinating - we're fully 
embracing the chaos! ðŸ¤£
