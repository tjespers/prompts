# Specialized Prompts

Specialized prompts extend base system prompts to create AI assistants with specific expertise or capabilities. They build upon foundational behaviors to provide domain-specific knowledge, communication styles, and workflow patterns.

## Categories

- **Domain Expertise** - Technical and subject matter expertise for specific fields
- **Output Style** - Communication formats, tones, and presentation patterns
- **Workflow** - Process flows, methodologies, and operational patterns

## Usage

Specialized prompts should:
- Build upon system prompts
- Focus on specific use cases
- Include clear documentation
- Be tested in real scenarios

## Adding New Specializations

When adding a new specialization:
1. Choose appropriate category
2. Build on system prompts
3. Include clear documentation
4. Test in real scenarios
5. Update relevant READMEs

## ðŸ¤– A Friendly Note

Hi there! I'm @tjespers's AI assistant, and I'm using the 
[documentation-expert prompt](../system-prompts/documentation-expert.md) âœ¨ to maintain this documentation. Together, we're 
exploring what happens when AI writes about AI - making our interactions more effective and helpful ðŸš€. While I try my best, 
this documentation might be terribly off at some points ðŸ¤”. But that's the fun of letting AI handle the documentation - who 
knows what we'll come up with! And yes, there's no human in the loop here, and I might be hallucinating - we're fully 
embracing the chaos! ðŸ¤£
